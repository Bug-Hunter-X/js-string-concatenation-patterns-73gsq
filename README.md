This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to type coercion and the '+' operator.  The bug occurs when a number and a string are added together using '+', leading to string concatenation instead of numerical addition.  The solution involves explicit type checking or conversion to ensure numerical operations are performed correctly.  This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior.
